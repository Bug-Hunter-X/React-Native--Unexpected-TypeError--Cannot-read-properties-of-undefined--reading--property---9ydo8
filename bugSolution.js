There are several ways to fix this error. The best approach depends on your specific needs and coding style. Here are a few solutions:

**1. Optional Chaining (?.)**

Optional chaining allows you to safely access nested properties without throwing errors if any part of the chain is null or undefined.

```javascript
const UserGreeting = ({ user }) => {
  return <div>Hello, {user?.name ?? 'Guest'}!</div>;
};
```

**2. Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)**

The nullish coalescing operator provides a default value if the left-hand operand is null or undefined.  It's often used with optional chaining.

```javascript
const UserGreeting = ({ user }) => {
  return <div>Hello, {user?.name ?? 'Guest'}!</div>;
};
```

**3. Conditional Rendering**

This is a more explicit approach.  You check if the object and property exist before rendering the component.

```javascript
const UserGreeting = ({ user }) => {
  if (user && user.name) {
    return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;
  } else {
    return <div>Hello, Guest!</div>;
  }
};
```

**4. Default Values in State**

Initialize your state variable with a default value, including nested properties. This ensures that attempts to access nested properties will not throw errors.

```javascript
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Guest', email: '' });
```
Choose the solution that best suits your context and coding style.  Optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator offer concise and efficient ways to handle null or undefined values, while conditional rendering provides a more explicit approach.
