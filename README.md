# React Native: Handling null or undefined object properties

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with various approaches for handling this situation.

The problem arises when accessing a property of an object before it has been properly initialized or populated with data, especially during asynchronous operations such as fetching data from an API.  This can lead to unexpected crashes and application instability.

Solutions include using optional chaining, the nullish coalescing operator, or adding conditional checks to ensure the object and its property exist before accessing them. This README explains the different solutions in detail.
