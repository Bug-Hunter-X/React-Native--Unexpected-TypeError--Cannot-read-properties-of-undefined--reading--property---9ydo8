This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  For example, if you have a state variable `user` and you try to access `user.name` before the `user` object has been populated, you'll encounter this error.  This often happens when fetching data asynchronously, where the data isn't available immediately.

```javascript
// Example of the error:
const UserGreeting = ({ user }) => {
  return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;
};

// If user is null, the above will throw an error.
```
